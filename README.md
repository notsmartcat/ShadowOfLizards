# Shadow Of Lizards Mod
At heart this is a Gore Mod made for Lizards from Rain World.

The Mod itself can be found on Steam here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3016292431

Even tho this is a Gore Mod there is way more then just gore.

I will list all things the Mod does in 4 different Sections: Physical, Immunities, Abilities and Transformations.

Firstly before going into any sections a main addition is allowing Lizards to Cheat Death.
Normally when a Lizard dies it is replaced by another Lizard after some Cycles, however with this mod each Lizard can Cheat Death and not be replaced when the next Cycle starts.

The Chance for a Lizard to Cheat Death can either be the same static Number between 0% and 100% (You can freely modify this number in the settings) for all Lizards 
or the Chance can be set to Dynamic meaning that the value is Randomly Generated for each Lizard between 0% and 100% (On top of this the static Number you set in the settings will be added onto the random number)

If a Lizard Cheats Death they will stay dead for the cycle so you can do anything you want with their body and all changes to the lizard will carry over the next time it is created.

# Spoilers for all the mod can do from here

# Physical
Physical Changes are changes to things that all Lizards have, most of these also have a visual impact on the Lizard.

Beheading: A Lizard can be beheaded if hit with a Stab or Bite in the neck area. When Heheaded a Cut Head Object is created and the Lizard also get's a -50% to it's Dynamic Cheat Death Chance, if the Lizard Succedes Cheating Death it gets 25% back. The Head Object itself doesn't have any uses however it can block spears. 
If a Lizard survives after heing heheaded it gain's it's head back the next cycle.

Dismembernment: When a Lizard get's hit in any BodyChunk that is not it's head with a Stab or Bite there is a chance for one of the Legs that chunk has to be cut off. Lizards with 6 Limbs share the additional Limbs between both BodyChunks. When a Leg is cut off that Limb's health will perminently be set to 0 and a cut Leg Object will be created and a -5% to it's Dynamic Cheat Death Chance. 
The cut leg Object can be eaten for quarter of a Food Pip for most SLugcats however Carnivorous Slugcats get Half a Food Pip. There are 2 variations of the Cut Arm sprites, one in which it is cut mostly in half and one where the actual Foot is only cut off, this is purely visual.

Blinding: Each of the Lizard's eyes can be either Blinded or Cut Out, doing either to both of Eyes will fully Blind the Lizard. A Lizard can be Blinded if a Flashbangs goes off close enough to them. A Lizards Eye can be cut out whenever it's HeadShield is hit with a Stab or Bite, there is a 70% chance that a Eye will be scarred reducing the effectivness of it by 50%, Blunt Damage can only Scar.
If the Eye is already Scarred or the 30% works the eye will be cut out Creating a Cut Eye Object which does not have any uses. There are 2 Variations of the Scarred Eye.

Deafening: Each of the Lizard's Ears can be Deafened if a Explosion happens close enough to the Lizard. A Lizard Can be made completely Deaf if both of it's ears are Deafened. The Deafened ears do not have any visuals due to Lizards not having ears.

Teeth Breaking: Lizard's Upper and Lower Teeth can be separetly broken, this can happens whenever the Lizard is hit in it's HeadShield. If one set of Teeth are Broken the Lizard has a 40% Chance to miss their Bite, if both sets of Teeth are broken the Lizard has a 70% Chance to miss their Bite. The Upper and Lower Teeth each have 4 different Sorite Variations, this is purely visual.

# Immunities
There are 3 Immunities a Lizard Can get, Immunity to Worm Grass, Immunity to Hypothermia and Immunity to Lava/Acid. The Only way to get the Immunities are either dying to the source or being created with it.

Worm Grass Immunity: Can Be gained by being consumed by Worm Grass while either dead or alive. There are Currently no ways to lose the Immunity, I am open to suggestions!

Hypothermia Immunity: Can be gained by getting max Hypothermia while either dead or alive. There are currently no ways to lose the Immunity, I am open to suggestions! This Immunity is automatically given to Lizards with the Melted Transformation.

Lava/Acid Immunity: Can be gained by "swimming" in Lethal Water while either dead or alive. There are no ways to lose the Immunity. This Immunity is dependent on the Lizards having the Melted Transformation. If the Melted Transfomration is turned Off this Immunity is gived without the need to have the Transformation. 
This Immunity allows the Lizards to at least be able to swim on top of water.

# Abilities
Abilities are Special functions that not all Lizards Have.

Tongue: A tongue can be Lost if the Lizard is hit in the Mouth. A Tongue can be Gained 2 different ways; firstly if a Lizard dies from falling off the map it can either gain a Tongue or the Cyan Jummp, when gaining the tongue this way it is chosen randomly from 7 Tongue types (The possible Tongue types are based on Tongues from all Lizards). 
The other way to get a Tongue is with Regrowth, If Regrowth is turned on the Lizard can eat a Tube Worm to gain a Special Tube Tongue or if "Regrowth by Cannibalism" setting is On Lizards can eat other Lizards which will give them a chance to steal that Lizards Tongue, this will remove the Tongue from the eaten Lizard.

Cyan Jump: The Cyan Jump can be lost if a Gas Leak occurs, this can happen if a Lizard is hit while charging up the jump. The Jump Ability can be Gained 2 different ways; firstly if a Lizard dies from falling off the map it can either gain the Cyan Jummp or a Tongue. 
The other way to get the Jump Ability is with Regrowth, If Regrowth is turned on the Lizard can eat; Yeek, Cicada, JetFish or Centiwing (Technically only the JetFish makes sense as it propels itself in a proper manner, a Voulture cannot be eaten so it doesn't count, the Yeek Jumps so it is a stretch and both the Cicada and Centiwing fly so tell me if I should change it) 
to gain the Jump Ability or if "Regrowth by Cannibalism" setting is On Lizards can eat other Lizards which will give them a chance to steal that Lizard's Jump Ability, this will remove the Jump Ability from the eaten Lizard.

There are 3 more Unimplemented Abilities, these are: Wall Climbing, BackgroundWall Climbing and Diving Underwater.

# Transformations
Transformations are special states that Modify the Lizard. Lizards can get a Transformation depending on the way they die. Each Transformation has 2 stages. In the first stage the effects can be reversed (Melted Transfomration cannot be reversed) while the second stage is permanent. Each of these Transformations can have their percentages changed and can also turned Off individually.
There are currently 3 Transformations:

# Spider Transformation:
This Transfomration can be Gained in 2 different ways; either by dying to spiders. The other way to get this Transformation is with Regrowth, If Regrowth and Spider Transformation Regrowth is turned on the Lizard can eat Spiders or other Lizards with this Transfomration. 
Once the first Stage starts it forces the Lizard to carry spiders inside it until it lives 3 cycles. This can be prevented by either killing the lizard and hoping it survives (Killing a Lizard during the first stage forces it to be Decapitated), 
this will let all the spiders out. Alternatively if the lizard has the ability to spit it has a 10% chance to spit Spiders alongside the actual Spit, this chance goes down tp 1% during the second stage. The spider reserve can be exhausted saving the Lizard (This will not make the lizard like you or hate you more). 

During the First Stage the Lizard will attack all spiders and other Lizards that have the second stage. While Spiders and other Lizards that have the second stage will Stay out of it's way. 

During the Second Stage the Lizard will Ignore all Spiders and will buddy up with other Lizards that have the second stage. They will avoid other Lizards that have the First Stage. The Lizard will SPit Dart Maggots instead of regular Spit.

# Electric Transformation:
This Transfomration can be Gained in 2 different ways; either by dying to Electricy. The other way to get this Transformation is with Regrowth, If Regrowth and Electric Transformation Regrowth is turned on the Lizard can eat Centipedes or other Lizards with this Transfomration. 
It can be prevented by hitting the Lizard with a depleted Electric Spear to steal the charge from it and not letting the Electric Lizard get zapped with electricity until it runs out of charges. Electric Lizard's Spit stuns any creature is touches. Whatever Bites the Electric Lizard get's stunned. Whatever is Bit by the Electric Lizard get's stunned.
Electric Lizards deal regular damage alongside extra Electric damage equal to half of regular damage.

During the First Stage the Lizard will Hunt all Centipedes.

During the Second Stage the Lizard will not go out of it's way to Hunt all Centipedes.

# Melted Transformation: 
This Transfomration can be Gained in 2 different ways; either by dying to Acid, even when dead. The other way to get this Transformation is with Regrowth, If Regrowth and Melted Transformation Regrowth is turned on the Lizard can eat other Lizards with this Transfomration. 
This cannot be prevented. The Lizard will in Agony until it fully Transforms after 3 cycles. Melted Lizard's Spit deals the same damage as Acid to any creature is touches. Melted Lizard's Bite deals the same damage as Acid.

During the First Stage the Lizard constantly be Annoyed and should not Bite.

During the Second Stage the Lizard will always be in the Hunt Behaviour.

All transformations can also be gained when a lizard is killed by a different lizard with the Transformation or when a Lizards eats anther Lizard with the Transformation.
